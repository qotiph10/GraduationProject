  "document": "Legacy Information Systems are large, vital software systems that resist modification and evolution. Solutions for these systems include freezing, outsourcing, maintenance, discarding, wrapping, and migration. Wrapping involves encapsulating legacy components with new software layers (Forward, Backward, System, Application, and Function wrappers) across various levels of encapsulation (Process, Transaction, Program, Module, and Procedure).",
