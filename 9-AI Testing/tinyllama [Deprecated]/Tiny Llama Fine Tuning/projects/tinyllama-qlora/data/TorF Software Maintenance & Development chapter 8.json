        "question": "The proactive reuse model is similar to the Waterfall model for conventional software.",
        "answer": "True"
      },
      {
        "question": "In the proactive approach, the system is designed only for current requirements with no regard for variations.",
        "answer": "False"
      },
      {
        "question": "The reactive approach develops reusable assets only when a reuse opportunity arises during product development.",
