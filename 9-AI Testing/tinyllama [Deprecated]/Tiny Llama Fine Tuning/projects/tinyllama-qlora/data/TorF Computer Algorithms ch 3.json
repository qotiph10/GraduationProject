      {
        "question": "The factorial of a number n can be computed using a recursive function that calls itself with argument n-1 until n equals 1.",

      },
      {
        "question": "In the recursive factorial implementation, the base case should return 0 instead of 1 for n == 1.",
        "answer": "False"
      },
      {
        "question": "The iterative factorial implementation multiplies a running product by i as it decrements i from n down to 1.",

        "question": "The Fibonacci sequence starts with the values 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, … in this lecture.",

        "question": "In the recursive Fibonacci function shown, the base case returns 1 when n <= 2.",

      {
        "question": "The Merge Sort algorithm sorts the left half, then sorts the right half, and finally merges them together.",
        "answer": "True"

        "question": "In Merge Sort, the merge function creates a temporary array of size low+high to hold merged elements.",
