  "document": "Legacy Information Systems (LIS) are vital, large-scale systems that resist modification. This chapter covers LIS definitions, characteristics (such as being geriatric and poorly documented), and solutions like wrapping and migration. Wrapping techniques include forward/backward database wrappers, system service, application, and function wrappers, across five levels of encapsulation: process, transaction, progress, module, and procedure.
