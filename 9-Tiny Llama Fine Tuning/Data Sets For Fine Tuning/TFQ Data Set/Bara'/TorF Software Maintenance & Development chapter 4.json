        "answer": "True"
      },
      {
        "question": "The primary goal of reengineering is to ignore existing software system artifacts like specifications and design.",

        "answer": "True"
      },
      {
        "question": "Abstraction helps maintenance personnel reduce complexity by focusing on significant information and hiding irrelevant details.",
        "answer": "True"
      },
      {
        "question": "Refinement is the process of increasing the level of abstraction of a system representation.",
        "answer": "False"
      },
      {
        "question": "Forward engineering is the downward movement from the highest level of abstraction to the lowest level of implementation.",
        "answer": "True"

        "question": "Reverse engineering involves an upward movement through the layers of abstractions.",

      },
      {
        "question": "Decompilation is an example of forward engineering where high-level program code is translated into object code.",
        "answer": "False"
      },
      {
        "question": "The four levels of abstraction and refinement are Conceptual, Requirements, Design, and Implementation.",
        "answer": "True"
      },

        "question": "Translating a program from BASIC to C is an example of a reengineering process.",
        "answer": "True"
      },
      {
        "question": "The model proposed by Eric J. Byrne suggests that reengineering consists of reverse engineering, re-design, and forward engineering.",
        "answer": "True"

        "question": "The Horseshoe model was developed by Kazman et al. to describe a three-step architectural reengineering process.",
        "answer": "True"

        "question": "Rehosting involves adding new features to the transformed targeted source code.",
        "answer": "False"
      },
      {
        "question": "Rehosting is effective when a user is satisfied with the system's functionality but wants better execution efficiency.",
        "answer": "True"
      },
      {
        "question": "Syntactic analysis and Program Slicing are techniques used for reverse engineering.",
